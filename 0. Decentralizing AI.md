## What Problem is Crynux Trying to Solve?

Crynux posits itself as an answer to the problem of decentralized artificial intelligence. 

As brought up by its creators and the author (Aaron Yuasa) of its Whitepapers ([(link)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/380564678_A_Review_on_Decentralized_Artificial_Intelligence_in_the_Era_of_Large_Models), [(link)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377567611_Crynux_Hydrogen_Network_H-Net_Decentralized_AI_Serving_Network_on_Blockchain)), large deep learning models and big AI present a set of challenges:
- Centralization and monopolization
- Privacy and security risks from centralized operations
- Lack of transparency and accountability
- Lack of incentive mechanisms to curate datasets, generate feedback for RLHF, etc.

These are all fair arguments to be made, especially with the sheer dominance that OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Meta etc. has when it comes to AI. Yes, there are open source means of running powerful LLMs yourself, but there's the intrinsic barriers in hardware cost, technical knowhow, etc.

Decentralization of AI follows in the same footsteps as the many laissez-faire "democratizing XYZ" products targeting different sectors that has come before it. However, decentralization of AI in particular is evidently non-trivial. Some issues that have been accurately pinpointed include:

- The need for verifiable decentralized computations, especially for large models that involve a lot of complex calculations
- Decentralized computing power should have low latency and be able to overcome bandwidth limitations
- Multi-Party Computation, Fully Homomorphic Encryption and Zero Knowledge Proofs are all wildly impractical to be applied to deep learning due to complexity and computing cost

Crynux purports itself as a practical means of accomplishing decentralized AI, leveraging a consensus algorithm and a "not proof of stake" tokenomic model.
