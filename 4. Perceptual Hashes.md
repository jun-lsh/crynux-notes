## Looking Into the Implementation

The perceptual hashing algorithm used is [`goimagehash`](github.com/corona10/goimagehash ), and the Hamming Distance calculation is performed on-chain via the [Hamming.sol](https://github.com/crynux-ai/crynux-contracts/blob/4c2d5814fd64b04f144009dea4f8e77a5c47e8d2/contracts/Hamming.sol) contract, which is called in [Task.sol](https://github.com/crynux-ai/crynux-contracts/blob/4c2d5814fd64b04f144009dea4f8e77a5c47e8d2/contracts/Task.sol#L611 ) with a threshold value of `5`. 

In case of unfamiliarity with Hamming distance, it's a fairly simple algorithm: between two outputs A and B, we step through them bit by bit. If a bit at the same position in output A is different from the bit at that position in output B, we increment the Hamming distance by one. e.g. 10111 and 01100 have a Hamming distance of 4.

The implementation of the pHash itself follows this blogpost: http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/432-Looks-Like-It.html

## Is this Gameable?

In terms of using less compute, it could be that you could get away with generating a lower quality image that generates the same pHash. However, it's quite unlikely that you can generate an image without running a model itself to generate something (although you could probably use a public model API or something) and receive a pHash that is valid.
