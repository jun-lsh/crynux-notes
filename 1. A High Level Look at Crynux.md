## Network Architecture

Crynux is several things, but to clarify what it **is not**:
- A means of splitting the compute needed for powerful models
- A means of generating cryptographically provable deep learning inferences
- A serverless network

To simplify in one fell swoop: The Crynux network is yet another P2P AI hookup system.

For the majority of the discussion, we will be looking at Crynux's image generation task (the "Hydrogen Network", accessible both on https://ig.crynux.ai/ and their Discord bot, "HappyAIGen") as the text generation/GPT task seems to be... very non-functional at the time and not particularly fleshed out yet.

The native token of the network is CNX, which is the currency used to pay for inference tasks and the reward token that node operators/compute providers will receive.

For the timebeing, the project is being run on the Dymension Blumbus Testnet ([explorer](https://bb.dym.fyi/r/dev-crynux))

### The Relay

Stated to be "a compromization (sic) on the decentralization of the network", the relay is where task arguments and the subsequent inferences are sent to, acting as a middleman between the end user and the compute provider. It's been deployed on https://relay.h.crynux.ai/

The creators recognize that there are issues with an off-chain solution like this, in particular if their server goes down, leaving tasks in limbo and there being no data for the on-chain verification to work off whether its a server failure or the nodes cheating.

### Nodes

These are our compute providers of the network. Every node stores local copies of the models that the end user would like to run (e.g. Stable Diffusion) and simply runs inferences and submits them to the relay. We will look at the consensus protocol, their answer to compute verification, later.

### Applications and the Blockchain

Applications that leverage the Crynux network can use APIs that serve as bridges to on-chain operations. The idea is for an end-user to simply connect a wallet with some CNX balance, make their requests and have a largely seamless experience.

### State of the Network

We can actually see how the network is doing here: https://netstats.crynux.ai/

We see quite a number of RTX A4400 and RTX A4500, which retail for about 1500 USD. Whether there are actually that many GPUs on the network or if they're being spoofed...

## Tokenomics

There's a handy disclaimer that says that this is all [work in progress](https://docs.crynux.ai/system-design/token-economy), so let's be brief with this.

On mainnet deployment:
- Total supply will be **8,617,333,262** tokens
- 20% of tokens will be minted on release to bootstrap the network
- The remaining 80% will be minted and distributed via node and task mining
### Node Mining
- 40% of tokens will be given to nodes for being online
- Tokens rewarded will be based on the node's "Quality of Service" (QoS) while online
	- We will look at the QoS later
- Token rewards will exponentially decay
- This is meant to incentivize bootstrapping

### Task Mining
- 40% of tokens will be given to nodes as rewards for completing tasks
- Distribution is based on the month's total count of tasks
- We naively assume that usage will grow exponentially, then use the [Avrami equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avrami_equation) to determine the token rewards
- The Avrami equation has three stages
	- Slow increase, so that the rewards aren't too high for too few nodes
	- Increasing speed in the middle to promote network growth
	- A cooldown since there are now enough nodes
- The choice of using Avrami seems to be nerd motivated (it concerns phase changes in chemistry) and isn't something used in other projects
